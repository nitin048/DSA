## 🎯 What is Topological Sorting in Graph using DFS?

### **Concept Overview:**
Ordering Dependency graphs using DFS Stacks.

### **Real-Life Analogy:**
Think of a graph like a **social network map**. People are points (Vertices), and friendships are the lines (Edges) connecting them. Some friendships are one-way (Directed), and some connections are closer than others (Weighted).

## 💡 Why Topological Sorting in Graph using DFS?

### **Advantages:**
- Universal modeling tool for network routes, dependencies, and connections
- BFS finds shortest paths in unweighted setups

### **Disadvantages / Challenges:**
- Adjacency matrix consumes O(V^2) space; adjacency list lookups are slower

### **When to Use:**
- For flight routes planning, GPS mapping, task scheduling (topological), and network latency analysis

---

## 📖 Core Concepts

- **Topological Sort:** Ordering DAG vertices such that for edge <i>u &rarr; v</i>, <i>u</i> comes before <i>v</i>.
- Push nodes to stack after visiting all neighbors.

---

## 💻 C++ Implementation Reference

```cpp
void topoDFS(int u, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<bool>& vis, stack<int>& st) {
    vis[u] = true;
    for (int v : adj[u]) if (!vis[v]) topoDFS(v, adj, vis, st);
    st.push(u); // Push to stack
}
```

## ⏱️ Algorithmic Complexity

| Aspect / Operation | Complexity |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Time Complexity | O(V + E) |
| Space Complexity | O(V) |

---

## 💡 Best Practices & Gotchas

- **Only applicable to Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).**
- **Boundary Checks:** Always check edge cases (empty inputs, single items, or extreme parameter ranges).
- **Resource Management:** Optimize storage usage to prevent memory leaks and minimize runtime overhead.

---

## 🎯 Practice Problems

### **Easy Problems:**
- [ ] Implement adjacency list
- [ ] BFS traversal
- [ ] DFS traversal

### **Medium Problems:**
- [ ] Cycle detection in Undirected/Directed graphs
- [ ] Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm)
- [ ] Dijkstra's Shortest Path

### **Hard Problems:**
- [ ] Tarjan's Bridge Finder
- [ ] Articulation Points detection
- [ ] Bellman-Ford with negative edge checks

---

## ✅ Checklist

- [ ] Mark vertices as visited to prevent infinite loops in cycles
- [ ] Use priority queues for Dijkstra to achieve O(E log V)
- [ ] Distinguish between cyclic vs DAG structures
