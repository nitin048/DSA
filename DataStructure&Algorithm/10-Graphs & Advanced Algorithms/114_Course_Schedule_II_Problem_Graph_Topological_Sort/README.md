## 🎯 What is Course Schedule II Problem Graph Topological Sort?

### **Concept Overview:**
Generating Valid Dependency orders (Course Schedule II).

### **Real-Life Analogy:**
Think of a graph like a **social network map**. People are points (Vertices), and friendships are the lines (Edges) connecting them. Some friendships are one-way (Directed), and some connections are closer than others (Weighted).

## 💡 Why Course Schedule II Problem Graph Topological Sort?

### **Advantages:**
- Universal modeling tool for network routes, dependencies, and connections
- BFS finds shortest paths in unweighted setups

### **Disadvantages / Challenges:**
- Adjacency matrix consumes O(V^2) space; adjacency list lookups are slower

### **When to Use:**
- For flight routes planning, GPS mapping, task scheduling (topological), and network latency analysis

---

## 📖 Core Concepts

- **Problem:** Return a valid ordering of courses.
- Run topological sort; if output size &lt; V, a cycle exists (return empty).

---

## 💻 C++ Implementation Reference

```cpp
// Implement Kahn's BFS or DFS topo sort.
// Return ordering vector if size == V, else empty list.
```

## ⏱️ Algorithmic Complexity

| Aspect / Operation | Complexity |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Time Complexity | O(V + E) |
| Space Complexity | O(V + E) |

---

## 💡 Best Practices & Gotchas

- **Kahn's BFS method simplifies cycle detection checks.**
- **Boundary Checks:** Always check edge cases (empty inputs, single items, or extreme parameter ranges).
- **Resource Management:** Optimize storage usage to prevent memory leaks and minimize runtime overhead.

## 🎯 Practice Problems

### **Easy Problems:**
- [ ] Implement adjacency list
- [ ] BFS traversal
- [ ] DFS traversal

### **Medium Problems:**
- [ ] Cycle detection in Undirected/Directed graphs
- [ ] Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm)
- [ ] Dijkstra's Shortest Path

### **Hard Problems:**
- [ ] Tarjan's Bridge Finder
- [ ] Articulation Points detection
- [ ] Bellman-Ford with negative edge checks

---

## ✅ Checklist

- [ ] Mark vertices as visited to prevent infinite loops in cycles
- [ ] Use priority queues for Dijkstra to achieve O(E log V)
- [ ] Distinguish between cyclic vs DAG structures
