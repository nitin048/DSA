## 🎯 What is Transform to Sum Tree?

### **Concept Overview:**
Converting Tree to Cumulative Child Sum values.

### **Real-Life Analogy:**
Think of a binary tree like a **family ancestry tree** starting from one founder. The founder (Root) has up to two children. Each child can have their own children, branching out to form leaf nodes at the edge.

## 💡 Why Transform to Sum Tree?

### **Advantages:**
- Efficiently represents nested hierarchies and decision patterns
- DFS/BFS traversals sweep structures cleanly

### **Disadvantages / Challenges:**
- Searching unsorted trees takes linear time O(N)

### **When to Use:**
- For hierarchical files directories, AST expression compilers, and decision systems

---

## 📖 Core Concepts

- **Sum Tree:** Node val is updated to sum of left & right children recursively.
- Return sum of tree node: `old_val + new_val`.

---

## 💻 C++ Implementation Reference

```cpp
int toSumTree(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return 0;
    int old = root->val;
    root->val = toSumTree(root->left) + toSumTree(root->right);
    return old + root->val;
}
```

## ⏱️ Algorithmic Complexity

| Aspect / Operation | Complexity |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Time Complexity | O(N) |
| Space Complexity | O(H) |

---

## 💡 Best Practices & Gotchas

- **Leaf nodes are updated to 0 because their child sums are zero.**
- **Boundary Checks:** Always check edge cases (empty inputs, single items, or extreme parameter ranges).
- **Resource Management:** Optimize storage usage to prevent memory leaks and minimize runtime overhead.

---

## 🎯 Practice Problems

### **Easy Problems:**
- [ ] Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder traversals
- [ ] Find height or max depth of tree
- [ ] Count total tree nodes

### **Medium Problems:**
- [ ] Level order BFS traversal
- [ ] Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
- [ ] Diameter of Binary Tree

### **Hard Problems:**
- [ ] Morris Inorder Traversal (O(1) space)
- [ ] Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

---

## ✅ Checklist

- [ ] Handle null nodes recursively as base cases
- [ ] Learn difference between DFS stack sweeps and BFS queue sweeps
- [ ] Understand time/space tradeoffs in iterative conversions
