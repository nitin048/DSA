## 🎯 What is Validate Binary Search Tree?

### **Concept Overview:**
Validating Binary Search Tree constraints.

### **Real-Life Analogy:**
Think of a Binary Search Tree (BST) like a **digitally sorted phone directory**. For any person (Node), everyone listed to their left has a smaller number, and everyone listed to their right has a larger number. This lets you find names in half the time.

## 💡 Why Validate Binary Search Tree?

### **Advantages:**
- Fast search, insertion, and deletion operations
- Maintains ordered sorted values dynamically

### **Disadvantages / Challenges:**
- Degrades to a skewed linear list O(N) if not balanced

### **When to Use:**
- When dynamic search and insertions must both be fast
- To implement ordered databases and sorted maps

---

## 📖 Core Concepts

- **Validation:** Validate BST rules recursively.
- Pass down minimum and maximum boundary values to child nodes.

---

## 💻 C++ Implementation Reference

```cpp
bool validate(TreeNode* root, long minVal, long maxVal) {
    if (!root) return true;
    if (root->val <= minVal || root->val >= maxVal) return false;
    return validate(root->left, minVal, root->val) && validate(root->right, root->val, maxVal);
}
```

## ⏱️ Algorithmic Complexity

| Aspect / Operation | Complexity |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Time Complexity | O(N) |
| Space Complexity | O(H) |

---

## 💡 Best Practices & Gotchas

- **Use long limits (`LONG_MIN`, `LONG_MAX`) to handle integer overflow conditions.**
- **Boundary Checks:** Always check edge cases (empty inputs, single items, or extreme parameter ranges).
- **Resource Management:** Optimize storage usage to prevent memory leaks and minimize runtime overhead.

---

## 🎯 Practice Problems

### **Easy Problems:**
- [ ] Search for a key in BST
- [ ] Insert a node in BST

### **Medium Problems:**
- [ ] Validate BST constraints
- [ ] Delete a node from BST
- [ ] Sorted array to balanced BST

### **Hard Problems:**
- [ ] Merge two BSTs optimally
- [ ] Recover BST with swapped nodes
- [ ] Largest BST in Binary Tree

---

## ✅ Checklist

- [ ] Pass constraints range bounds [Min, Max] recursively in validation checks
- [ ] Understand why inorder successor search is needed in deletions
- [ ] Keep BSTs balanced (AVL/Red-black tree concepts)
